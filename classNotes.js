*difference netween hooks an a regular function

*the hooks could be used by other hooks!

*stateful components: class Comp, and hooks, cause they have state...

*on the [] of the new hook, we put the objects that we are going to need/use later

*they could be exported aswell

*on the field, we should also define the "defaultValue" as {fields.NAMEoFtHEiMPUT}

*for useLoginRegisterPost()/ useAuthPost() we have to pass as arguments the components that we have on the hook fn

SYMBOLS!! 17/09

var s = Symbol();

var s = Symbol('abc');



// always with capital S, but is not a constructor
// cant be converted into a number, but is also Not a NaN
// you cant concatenate,

no symbol equals other symbol, they are unique!

this means that could be use as keys for objects,

so you give properties on a way that dont overwrite the obj property, and make it harder to someone else overwrite those properties
